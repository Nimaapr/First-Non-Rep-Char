# String-Algorithms
Solutions to various string manipulation problems, including finding the first non-repeating character, edit distance, and palindrome partitioning

## Projects in this Repository

### 1. [First Non-Repeating Character Finder](First-Non-Repeating-Character-Finder/)
This project includes a Python script to identify the first non-repeating character in a string. It's a straightforward and practical tool for string analysis.

### 2. [Palindrome Partitioning I](Palindrome-Partitioning-I/)
This folder contains two different Python implementations for the Palindrome Partitioning I problem: a backtracking solution and an optimized dynamic programming approach.
