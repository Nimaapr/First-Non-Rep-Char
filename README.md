# String-Algorithms
Solutions to various string manipulation problems, including finding the first non-repeating character, edit distance, palindrome partitioning, and distinct subsequences.

## Projects in this Repository

### 1. [First Non-Repeating Character Finder](First-Non-Repeating-Character-Finder/)
This project includes a Python script to identify the first non-repeating character in a string. It's a straightforward and practical tool for string analysis.

### 2. [Palindrome Partitioning I](Palindrome-Partitioning-I/)
This folder contains two different Python implementations for the Palindrome Partitioning I problem: a backtracking solution and an optimized dynamic programming approach.  
[Read more](Palindrome-Partitioning-I/README.md)

### 3. [Edit Distance Algorithms](Edit-Distance/)
The Edit Distance project provides two implementations of the Edit Distance (Levenshtein distance) algorithm: a standard dynamic programming approach and a memory-efficient version.  
[Read more](Edit-Distance/README.md)

### 4. [Distinct Subsequences](Distinct-Subsequences/)
The Distinct Subsequences project offers two Python approaches for finding the number of distinct subsequences of one string that match another. It includes a standard dynamic programming approach and a memory-efficient variant.  
- **Standard Approach**: Utilizes a 2D matrix for dynamic programming (Time Complexity: O(mn), Space Complexity: O(mn)).
- **Memory-Efficient Approach**: Optimizes space using two 1D arrays (Time Complexity: O(mn), Space Complexity: O(n)).
